# The All Tool

Basically, the all tool is the projects that I work on in my free/bored time. It contains a few, very simple applications that can be used on a daily basis in very small and specific tasks.

# Each App Folder contains its own readme.

If you navigate to app/Apps, you'll find all the different apps there each contained in its own folder. In that folder, you'll find all the code that is used to build that app encapsulated there.

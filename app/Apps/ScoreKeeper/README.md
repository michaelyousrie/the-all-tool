# Score Keeper

Often, I've played cards with my wife and we both lost track of our score in the game. Hence, the Score Keeper was born.

## What does it do?

It keeps score of course. You can add a number of players to the board and manually update their score each round when it ends.

## Expected incoming features:

1. Save a snapshot of the current scoreboard to local storage
